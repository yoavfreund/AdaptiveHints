This style for L@S 2014 papers is based on the CHI 2014 full paper
style.

See learningatscale.acm.org/#wip for length restrictions and other
format requirements.

- When setting title and authors, be sure to change both the \title,
  \author, etc. macro arguments and the PDF attributes in the
  \hypersetup macro. 

- If your paper is accepted, ACM will assign you a unique Digital Object
  Identifier for your paper in the ACM Digital Library.  When you
  prepare final camera-ready, you'll substitute that number for the
  "((DOI HERE))" placeholder.

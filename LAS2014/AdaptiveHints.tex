\begin{abstract}
Hints are sometimes used in online learning system to help students
when they are having difficulties. However, in all of the systems we
are aware of, the hints are fixed ahead of time and do not depend on
the unsuccessful attempts the student has already made. This severely
limits the effectiveness of the hints.

We have developed an alternative system for giving hints to
students. The main difference is that the system allows an instructor
to send a hint to a student {\em after} the student the student has
made several attempts to solve the problem and failed.  After
analyzing the student's mistakes, the instructor is better able to
understand the problem in the student's thinking and send them a more
helpful hint.

We have deplyed this system in a probability and statistics course
with 176 students. We have demonstrated the superiority of the new
hints methodology over the traditional one.

The limiting factor on the effectiveness of our system is the amount
of manual labor required to send each hint. This is the main obstacle
we see in scaling this approach to larger classes and to MOOCs. We
are currently exploring several approaches for addressing this
problem: 1) Letting students send hints to their peers. 2) Creating
hint libraries. 3) Using machine learning methods to automate
the process of mapping student mistakes to the most relevant hint.
